What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git file which has all the data regarding the commits and other parameters which are needed to be kept track of while using Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area lets us choose which all files to commit from the repository rather than the whole repository.
